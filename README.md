# Vc Ping
A discord bot written in typescript designed to notify server members when a voice call is active.

## Setup
Make sure you have node.js installed, and create an ``.env`` file that includes your bots ``TOKEN``.
 ```bash
git clone <url>  # clone the repository :)
npm install      # install the packages
npx tsc          # compile the typescript
npm run start    # run the bot!
```
